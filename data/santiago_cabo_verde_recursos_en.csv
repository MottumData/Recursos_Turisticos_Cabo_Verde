",Pico d´Antónia,Natural Places,Mountains and Mountains,"It is a mountainous massif, of volcanic origin, located west of the municipality of São Salvador do Mundo (SSM), more specifically between Ribeira de Leitãozinho and Ribeira de Faveta. One of its singularities is due to the fact that it is the highest point on the island of Santiago (1394 meters) and the third at national level, as well as its grandeur over the two large Ribeiras (Picos and Órgãos), especially because it testifies to the existence of a large volcanic device that was once at the origin of the formation of the island. On the other hand, its grandeur also gives the feeling of a natural monument as guardian of the municipality, therefore a visiting card of this territory. Pico de Antónia is a natural monument located in the center of the island of Santiago, at the crossroads of the municipalities of São Lourenço dos Órgãos, Ribeira Grande de Santiago, S. Domingos and Santa Catarina. According to some historians, it was named Pico de Antónia in honor of António de Noli, one of the discoverers of the Cape Verde islands. This geological heritage is the largest volcanic building of the Mio-Pliocene age, consisting essentially of lavas of a basaltic nature. From a geomorphological point of view, it is characterized by steep slopes, marked by incised ravines and valleys that take on different shapes and dimensions, resulting from water erosion. It is the highest elevation on the island of Santiago with approximately 1392 m of altitude, which is responsible for the occurrence of microclimates that favor the development of biodiversity and endemism.
